Visual impairment affects millions worldwide, necessitating innovative solutions for enhanced mobility and safety. This study proposes iSense, a smart walking stick developed using Arduino and IoT technologies for object detection and navigation. By integrating ultrasonic sensors, iSense offers real-time feedback to visually impaired users, addressing limitations of traditional white canes. Through a user-centered design approach, the system prioritizes accuracy and user-friendliness. Initial testing demonstrates iSense's ability to detect obstacles within 0.4 meters and provide haptic feedback. Future research aims to expand functionalities to meet diverse user needs. Overall, iSense holds promise in improving independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals while offering insights for future assistive technology development.
